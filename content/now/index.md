This is my Now Page. It describes what my current situation is, including my employment status, tech stack, and general view on various topics. It is meant to be a living page apart from the [About me]({{% relref "/about" %}}) page.

# Peritz Now

I am currently employed working as the Data and Engineering Team Lead for a CTI department at a global cybersecurity assurance firm. I am not seeking employment elsewhere.

## Technology Stack

I will exclude particular details about my work setup to maintain a level of security within my organisation. Safe to say though, that many of the programs I use in my personal life also extend to my work life. You've probably already guessed at that (because everyone does it).

My personal laptop is a Macbook Pro 2019 with Touchbar. I also have a desktop computer functioning as a basic server running Debian. I have a Google Pixel 6A running GrapheneOS.

I use my personal computer for day-to-day activities, browsing and such. I also do some development on it when the mood takes me outside of work, and I write any blog posts on it too. I have a RAID setup on my Debian server which takes care of all my files. I backup all my devices regularly to the server and the backup the server to a separate hard drive. My phone is my phone, what more do you want.

The following table demonstrates what programs I use for what purpose:


| Function             | Software                            | Notes                                                                                                                    |
